A talk-like client/server setup written in node.js

Protocol:

GET /   -> blocks and then returns text; closes connection
POST /  -> sends text to all clients

To try it out:

$ ./client clone c1     # Create a client
$ ./client clone c2     # another client
$ ./server &

$ ./c1                  # Runs the first client
$ scp c2 somewhere@else:
$ ssh somewhere@else
ssh$ ./c2 connect server-hostname
